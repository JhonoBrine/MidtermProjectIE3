        The summary statistics provide a quick overview of the key attributes in the dataset. For each numeric column, you can see:

        1. Whiskers:
        - The lower whisker represents the minimum value of the dataset, matching the minimum value in the table and Image 2.1.
        - The upper whisker represents the maximum value of the dataset, aligning with the maximum value in the table and as seen in Image 2.1.

        2. Boxes:
        - The lower box reflects the first quartile (Q1), representing the 25th percentile of the data. This matches the Q1 value in the table and the code output in Image 1.0.
        - The upper box reflects the third quartile (Q3), representing the 75th percentile, which also matches the values in the table and Image 2.1.
